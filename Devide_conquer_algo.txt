# A divide and conquer algorithm is a strategy of solving a large problem by

1. breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems
2. solving the sub-problems, and
3. combining them to get the desired output.

# How Divide and Conquer Algorithms Work?

1. Divide: Divide the given problem into sub-problems using recursion.
2. Conquer: Solve the smaller sub-problems recursively. If the subproblem is small enough, 
    then solve it directly.
3. Combine: Combine the solutions of the sub-problems that are part of the recursive process
    to solve the actual problem.


# Divide and Conquer Vs Dynamic approach 
  The divide and conquer approach divides a problem into smaller subproblems;
  these subproblems are further solved recursively. The result of each subproblem 
  is not stored for future reference, whereas, in a dynamic approach, the result 
  of each subproblem is stored for future reference.

# Advantages of Divide and Conquer Algorithm

1. The complexity for the multiplication of two matrices using the naive method is O(n3), 
   whereas using the divide and conquer approach (i.e. Strassen's matrix multiplication) is O(n2.8074). 
   This approach also simplifies other problems, such as the Tower of Hanoi.
2. This approach is suitable for multiprocessing systems.
3.It makes efficient use of memory caches.
