A Linklist is a linear data structure that includes a series of 
connected nodes. Here each nodes stores the DATA and the ADDRESS 
of the next node 

We gave the first NODE a special name called HEAD and the last node is NULL 
The power of a linked list comes fro the ability to break the chain and rejoin 
with the new element in between

Linked List Complexity
 Time Complexity         
          Worst case            Average case 
search    O(n)                    O(n)
Insert    O(1)                    O(1)
Deletion  O(1)                    O(1)

Space Complexity O(n)

Application of Linklist
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Implemented in stack and queue 
- in undo functionallity og softwares 
- hash table , Graph
