Queue follow the First in first out (FIFO) rule - the item that gors in 
first is the item that comes out first

-- Basic operations of Queue
  - Enqueue : add an element to the and of the Queue
  - Dequeue : Remove an element from the front of the Queue
  - IsEmpty : check if queue is IsEmpty
  - IsFull  : check if the queue is IsFull
  - Peek :   get the value of the queue without removing it 

• Wrking of the queue
 - two pointers FRONT and REAR 
 - Front Track the first element of the queue
 - Rear track the last element of the queue
 - initially set the value of FRONT and REAR to -1

• Complexity Analysis
 
 the complexity of the enqueue and dequeue operations in a queue using an arrey is O(1)
 if we use pop(n) in python then the complexity might be O(n)

TYPES OF Queue 
• Simple Queue :
                In a simple queue , insertion takes place at the rear and removal
                occurs at the front it Strictly follows the FIFO (first in first out)
• Circular Queue :
               In a circular queue the last element point to the first making 
               link of the queue. the main advantage is the no memory is wasted 
               online simple queue

      The Complexity of the enqueue and dequeue opeartions of a circular queue 
      is O(1) for arrey Implementation

      ‣ APPLICATION OF CIRCULAR Queue
        - CPU scheduling
        - Memory managment
        - Traffic managment


• Priority Queue :
                 is a special type of queue in which each element is associated 
                 with a Priority value and element are served on the basis of their 
                 priority that is higher priority element are served first .
                 - if element with the same priorty occur they are served according 
                   to their order in the queue. 
                 - Generally the value of the element itself is considered for 
                   assigning the priority
                 - we can also set priorities according tto our needs

                ‣ DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRIORITY QUEUE AND NORMAL QUEUE
                  - in normal queue it follows FIFO
                  - in priority queue the values are removed on the basis of priority
                ‣ IMPLEMENTATION 
                    priority queue can be implemented using an arrey,Linked list , a heap or
                    binary search tree among these DS heap provides an efficient implementation 
                    of priority queue
                  
                ‣ COMPLEXITY ANALYSIS
                       Operations             Peek       Insert       delete

                        Linked List           O(1)       O(n)           O(1)
                        Binary Heap           O(1)       O(logn)        O(logn)
                        Binary Search tree    O(1)       O(logn)        O(logn)


• Double Ended Queue (Deqeue) :
                             Insertion and removal of elements can be performend
                             from either from the front or rear . it does not follow
                             FIFO
                            ‣ TYPES OF DEQUE
                              - Input Restricted deque
                                 input is restricted at a single end but allows Deletion
                                 at both the ends
                              - Output Restricted deque
                                output is restricted  at a single end but allows insertion
                                at both the ends 
                            
                            ‣ TIME COMPLEXITY
                                the time complexity of all the above operations is constent O(1)
                            
                            ‣ APPLICATION OF DEQUE DS
                              - in undo operations on softwares
                              - to store history in browser 
                              - for implementing both stacks and queues
