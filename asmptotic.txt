The study of change in performance of the algorithm with 
the change in the order of the input size is defined as 
asymptotic analysis.

ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION :
    Asymptotic notations are the mathematical notations 
    used to describe the running time of an algorithm when 
    the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.

they are mainly of three types
• Big-O-notation
• Omega notation
• Theta notation

# Big-O-notation  (O-notation)

Big-O-notation represents the uppper bound of the ruunning time 
of an algorithem.thus it gives the wrost-case complexity of an 
algorithem.it widely used to analyze an algorithm as we are always 
interested in wrost case scenario

# Omega notation  (Ω-notation)
Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithem
thus it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm

# Theta Notation (Θ-notation)

Theta notation enclose the function from above and below . since 
it represent the upper and the lower bound of the running time 
of an algorithm ,it is ussed for analyzing the average-case 
complexity of an algorithm
