Used to find the time complexity of the code 

The master method is a formula for solving recurrence relations of the form:

Formula :

T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n),
where,
n = size of input
a = number of subproblems in the recursion
n/b = size of each subproblem. All subproblems are assumed 
     to have the same size.
f(n) = cost of the work done outside the recursive call, 
      which includes the cost of dividing the problem and
      cost of merging the solutions

Here, a â‰¥ 1 and b > 1 are constants, and f(n) is an asymptotically positive function.
